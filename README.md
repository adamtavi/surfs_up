## Summary
In conclusion the Surf Shop should be able to be open all year long as the averages are very similar and won't seem to effect business assuming that summer month's are their highest grossing profit based on temp. Two additional queries that you would perform to gather more weather data for June and December is to look write one query for percipiation in June and second query for December. Assessing the rain that falls down in a particular time of the year can affect sales and should be evaluated.
